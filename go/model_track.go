 * Shottower
 *
 * Shottower is the open source version of Shotstack which is a video, image and audio editing service that allows for the automated generation of videos, images and audio using JSON and a RESTful API.  You arrange and configure an edit and POST it to the API which will render your media and provide a file  location when complete.  For more details visit [shottower](https://github.com/DblK/shottower) or checkout our [getting started](https://shotstack.io/docs/guide/) documentation.  There are two main API's, one for editing and generating assets (Edit API) and one for managing hosted assets (Serve API).  The Edit API base URL is: <b>http://0.0.0.0:4000/{version}</b>  The Serve API base URL is: <b>http://0.0.0.0:4000/serve/{version}</b>
